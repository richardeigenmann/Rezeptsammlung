<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<h3>Pastry:</h3>
<p>(Can be abbreviated by using ready made Kuchen- or Bl&auml;tterteig, best might be ready made M&uuml;rbeteig but remember to bake it as a first step.)</p>

<p>Make the pastry by rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients (sugar, flour, ground nuts); pat into a round and leave in a cool place for 1/2 hour.</p>

<p>Butter and flour a flan rind. Knead pastry for a few minutes to make it pliable. Roll out the pastry, line the flan ring with it, and prick all over with a fork. Bake in a moderate oven, 375 deg. F. (= 190&deg;C) until golden brown. Set aside to cool.</p>

<h3>Filling:</h3>
<p>Grate the rind off the lemon and squeeze out the juice.</p>

<p>Pour cornflour into a bowl with about 1/2 cupful of the milk and dissolve it completely.</p>
<p>Boil remainder of milk, and pour over cornflour. Return milk mixture to stove and cook until thick, stirring. <strong>Note:</strong> it will clot right away unless you stir vigorously! Then pour into a bowl, leave to cool, stirring from time to time.</p>

<p>Separate the eggs, putting the eggwhite in a bowl for beating and beating the yolks into the milk one by one.</p>
<p>Then add the sugar and lemon rind and juice.</p>
<p>Bake for 2(!) minutes in a very slow oven, 300 deg. F. (= 150&deg;C).</p>

<h3>Meringue:</h3>
<p>This will give you just about enough time to whisk the egg whites for the meringue.</p>
<p>Whisk the eggwhite until stiff with little spikes sticking out when removing the whisk.</p>
<p>Carefully add the sugar into the eggwhite. Avoid overbeating.</p>
<p>Pile meringue on top of pie, return to oven at same temperature and leave until meringue has dried, just before turning brown. Perhaps 20 minutes.</p>

<h2>Valuation:</h2>
<p>A bit on the sweet side (see the copious quantities of sugar going in). The meringue is also a bit on the challenging side. Apparently one can beat eggwhite for as long as one likes. The taste is very nice, definitely a recipe to try again and again. RE, 23.12.2006</p>
<p>Did this again on 24 Dec 2010 and got all confused with the eggs. Have straightened out the recipe now. Also the 170g of sugar is rather a lot but I didn't realise that caster sugar is Puderzucker. RE</p>
<p>27 May 2012 made a mess of the recipe despite trying to do it right. Bought the ready-made dough but didn't bake it before the filling came on. Then the eggwhites don't beat stiff with the sugar in them. First beat the egg whites and then add the sugar carefully. Discovered that Castor sugar is finer sugar than the normal sugar but not icing sugar. Migros sells a superfine sugar. Best to use the beater and not the Bamix. With the Bamix you need to pour boiling watter over the shaft and add the same amount of warm water to the egg whites and some Cream of Tartar (or substitue this with Salt).</p>
